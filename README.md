![snake-game](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93847324/169435015-a3eb571e-7a93-4eb4-87b5-8ebd0977b1ab.JPG)


The idea for this project was to re-create the classic snake game using vanilla JS.

Use your arrow keys to navigate the screen and eat the food! If you're on mobile/smaller screen, use the arrow keys available on your screen

This game:
* Tracks the food you've eaten
* Tracks the number of blocks you've traversed
